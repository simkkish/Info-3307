<h4>Introduction</h4>
    <br />
 <p><strong>Company Background:</strong> </p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lost River Winder Riders, a free-flight sports shop in central Idaho, opened in 1990 to sell and service hang gliding, paragliding, and snow kiting equipment. The company started as a co-op to allow the owners and a few of their friends to buy top name equipment and accessories for their hang gliding and paragliding hobbies at a reduced rate. As more enthusiasts became involved in free -flight sports, the owners saw an opportunity to leverage their hobby into a full-time business while still doing what they loved.
As stated on company’s site free-flight sports are seasonal, so the company extended their sales line into winter sports. In keeping with the theme of air-reliant vehicles they decided to add snow kitting equipment to their line of offering in order to insure year round business. The latest addition to their company line came in 2006, when they began sales and service of powered ultralight aircraft. The market for free-flight sporting equipment in the central Idaho area has been booming and annual sales have increased from $20,000 in 1990 to more than $1,200,000 in 2004 to $2,300,000  in 2013.
The present location has a showroom, a warehouse, and repair facilities. The showroom is a four thousand square foot expanse, allowing sufficient room to examine the various models that are available. The state-of-the-art warehouse features catalogued and indexed parts ready for installation. The company has both indoor and outdoor repair areas, allowing for several repairs to be performed simultaneously. All of this is nestled in a pristine setting with a nearby escarpment that can be used for hang gliding and paragliding takeoffs for those who want to “test drive” the equipment. The company now employs approximately twelve people in various capacities including sales management, general support and repair and maintenance.

<p><strong>Problem (that made a system necessary):</strong></p>
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  As their customer base and sales increased, they began to experience problems with inventory control, missing reorder points and experiencing inventory stock-outs that resulted in lost sales. Company records were maintained using an off-the-shelf accounting program, with additional information derived using Excel spreadsheets. 
The company was unable to determine sales history and trends from the current system, and needed better control of capital by insuring that needed items were purchased and less popular items were not. In 2005 Lost River Wind Riders engaged the services of a consultant who specialized in systems analysis and design to analyze and update their system.
