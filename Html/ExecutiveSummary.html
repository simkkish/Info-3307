    <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Goals</b><br />
        The Wind Riders of the Lost River Range (WRLRR) sales and customer base has been growing following the booming market for free-flight sporting equipment in the central Idaho. In the past decade, the company has doubled its sales revenue. With this constant growth in business makes it necessary to improve the current system by modifying information access and record keeping. The main objective of this project is to improve the business customer service by making the record of products and sales easily available to manager and analyze the future system after adding new services.
        <br />
        <b>Problems</b><br />
        The past problem of weak record keeping and inventory control had resulted in lost sales. The company was able to solve this issue and achieve better control of inventory in the current system. However, the increasing customer base required company to further improve the customer service by making the process of purchasing system faster. In addition, the company’s decision of adding ultralight aircraft to their sales resulted in issues of government regulations regarding strict record keeping.  This brought challenges for managers to keep strict records on vehicle certification and registration, and required their customers to complete training lessons in order to purchase a powered ultralight.
        <br />
        <b>Results</b><br />
        The new system will automate the process of equipment purchase through product placard making the process faster and easier. This means that the business will run more efficiently after the improvements in customer service. The new system also addresses the new services that are recently added by WRLRR in the service list. It modifies the current system by adding the new processes and also ensuring the effective flow of inventory, products, and sales record to the manager. Manager will be able to access information about product’s sales history and trend, and reorder points providing better control of inventory.
        <br />
        <b>Recommendations</b><br />
        It is highly recommended that the WRLRR implement an updated system which better tracks the equipment information and improve the process of customer service. The new services that are recently added require the company to modify the current system. In addition, the continuous growth of market for free-flight sports equipment makes it necessary that the purchasing process be short by implementing the automatic methods. Without the improved and automated system, WRLRR will likely face the past problems of lost sales due to poor inventory control. The modification cost is estimated very little relative to the cost that arises from lost sales, and just in little expense WRLRR will be able to remain competitive and satisfy their customer.
