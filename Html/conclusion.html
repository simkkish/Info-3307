<h4>Summary and Conclusion</h4>
    <br />
<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After making a clear analysis on the system, we can see that the current system utilized by Wind Riders of the 
Lost River Range (WRLRR) has proven to be successful in tracking and increasing sales up to this point. But the current system fails to satisfy the 
demands of many valuable customers. For the grand success for this company, WRLRR must implement the system that we proposed with this project.
 This proposed system by our group will help to achieve the goals and mission as we set on out executive summary. As we proposed the system which is cost effective
  and efficient strategy, updating this system would lead the whole company to the new path of success. 
</p>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  Moreover, to attract the customers to this system, this system must be upgraded to the new one to meet the needs and requirements
 of modern customers to satisfy them. As our team make a decisions after a several projects design and implementation, upgrading to the proposed system would be
  very important change for the WRLRRâ€™s business portfolio eventually leads to the success on the business and prevent from various negative consequences.
